May or may not be a robot. Proof (or not) from a scene by Beckett. 

E: In the meantime let us try and converse calmly, since we are incapable of keeping silent. 
V: You're right, we're inexhaustible. 
E: It's so we won't think.
V: We have that excuse. 
E: It's so we won't hear. 
V: We have our reasons. 
E: All the dead voices. 
V: They make a noise like wings. 
E: Like leaves. 
V: Like sand. 
E: Like leaves. 

Silence. 

V: They all speak at once. 
E: Each one to itself. 

Silence. 

V: Rather they whisper. 
E: They rustle. 

Silence

V: What do they say?
E: They talk about their lives. 
V: To have lived is not enough for them. 
E: They have to talk about it.
V: It is not sufficient. 

Silence. 

V: They make a noise like feathers. 
E: Like leaves. 
V: Like ashes. 
E: Like leaves. 
 
Long Silence. 

V: Say something! 
E: I'm trying. 

Long Silence.
